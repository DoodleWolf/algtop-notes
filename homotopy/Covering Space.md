### Definition
A *covering space* of $X$ is a space $\tilde X$ and a map $p : \tilde X \to X$ such that for each point $x \in \tilde X$ there exists a [[neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ such that $p^{-1}\left(U\right)$ is a union of disjoint [[open set]]s, each of which is mapped [[homeomorphic]]ly onto $U$ by $p$.

Such a [[neighborhood]] $U$ is called *evenly covered*.
