### Types
- $(X, x_0)$ : [[Pointed Space]]
### Statement
Suppose $A_\alpha$ are [[Path Connected Space|path connected]] [[open set|open]] subsets of $X$, each containing $x_0$, and each $A_\alpha \cap A_\beta$ is also [[Path Connected Space|path connected]], such that:
$$
X = \bigcup\limits_\alpha A_\alpha
$$
Let $\psi$ be the [[group homomorphism]] obtained by applying the lemma [[Extending Homomorphisms to the Free Product]], from the [[induced homomorphism]]s of $A_\alpha$.
Then $\psi$ is surjective. Moreover, if $A_\alpha \cap A_\beta \cap A_\gamma$ are [[Path Connected Space|path connected]], then the [[Group Homomorphism Kernel|kernel]] of $\psi$ is the [[Normal Subgroup]] generated by all elements of the form $i_{\alpha\beta}\left(\omega\right)i_{\beta\alpha}\left(\omega\right)^{-1}$ where $\omega$ is an element of the [[fundamental group]] of $A_\alpha \cap A_\beta$.
The following isomorphism with a [[quotient group]] holds:
$$
\pi_1\left(X\right) \equiv *_\alpha \pi_1\left(A_\alpha\right)/ker(\psi).
$$
