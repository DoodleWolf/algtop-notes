### Types
- $X$ : [[Topological Space]]
- $A$ : [[Subspace Topology|subspace]] of $X$
- $\{ C_n(X), \partial _n \}$ : [[Singular Chain Complex]] of $X$

### Definition
First, we define the chain complex $C(X,A)$ known as the relative chain complex which will be $\{ C_n(X)/C_n(A), \tilde \partial_n\}$ where $\tilde \partial_n$ is the induced map of $\partial _n$ on the quotient subgroup.
The relative homology groups $H_n(X,A)$ will be the homology groups of the relative chain complex.
