#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is an [[Continuity|continuous]] bijection that is either [[Open Map]] or [[Closed Map]], then it is a [[Homeomorphism]].
### Proof
WLOG we will prove the open case. 
- $f$ is a bijection.
- $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]].
- $f$ being an [[Open Map]] implies that $f^{-1}$ is [[Continuity|continuous]].
