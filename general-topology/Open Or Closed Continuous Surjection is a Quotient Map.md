#lemma
### Types
- `X` `Y` : [[Topological Space]] 
- $f : X \to Y$
### Statement
If $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]], surjective, and either [[Open Map]] or [[Closed Map]], then it is a [[Quotient Map]].
### Proof
WLOG we will prove the case when $f$ is [[Open Map]]. Let $U \subset Y$ such that $f^{-1}\left( U \right)$ is [[Open Set|open]], then $U = f\left( f^{-1} (U) \right)$ is [[Open Set|open]], completing the proof.
